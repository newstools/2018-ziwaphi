Residents of Kanyamazane have once more prevented embattled Mpumalanga Premier, Refilwe Mtsweni from addressing them. 
This was after Mtsweni’s Spokesperson, Zibonele Mncwango had issued a Media alert that she would be addressing the community at Kanyamazane on Monday morning.
Police and government vehicles started gathering inside the stadium to the surprise of community leaders and residents who had rejected Mtsweni last week.
Angry community leaders told journalists that Mtsweni had disrespected them by planning to address the community without the community’s consent.
Leaders told the community members to move out of the stadium, leaving the police and suit clad government officials behind.
They instead gathered outside the community hall which is adjacent to the stadium.
“She can address the police and those wearing their suits,” said  said a community member. 
Leaders told the media that they met Mtsweni from Sunday until the early hours on Monday, and they warned her not to come to Kanyamazane, but were taken by surprise when officials and police descended on the stadium.
They vowed to continue with the crippling strike until President Cyril Ramaphosa gives them a hearing.
ANC spokesperson, Sibusiso Themba, however, told the media that there were no plans for Mtsweni to address the community.
Premier’s spokesperson, Zibonele Mncwango’s phone rang unanswered.
