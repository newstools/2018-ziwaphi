In 2011, the deputy president of the Republic of South Africa, David Mabuza, while he was premier in Mpumalanga province, made a promise to construct a sports academy, which later changed its name to the High-Altitude Training Centre, at Emakhazeni local municipality, and a cultural hub, also called the Creative Industries Cultural Hub in White River.
We track how, through all these years, he gave the people of the province the impression that something was happening, until he left the province to become the country’s deputy president, without being held to account, and not even a single brick laid, besides hundreds of millions already spent on the projects.
It is difficult to get the exact money that government has spent on the two projects because the information provided by officials and politicians does not tally. It’s mostly inadequate and they deliberately answer questions that they have not been asked just to confuse the public (See an article on this). Government officials claim that they have spent R252 936 000, however, Ziwaphi’s estimate is that R300 million or even much more may have been spent on the projects. This is based on analysis of official documents from provincial treasury, annual reports and speeches of politicians.
Based on this analysis, Ziwaphi estimates that between 2011 and 2018, the government allocated R405 258 000,00.
The two projects were supposed to have been completed in 2017, but eight years later and hundreds of millions spent, not a single brick has been laid, and Mabuza appointed his successor, Refilwe Mtsweni’s spokesperson, Zibonele Mncwango, has also failed to respond to questions sent to her office, and even failed to honour an interview promised with Mtsweni.
